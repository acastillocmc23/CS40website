            Systems Biology: The science of understanding biological systems from genes to physical structures including dynamics, control methods, and modification/design:<br>
            I. Biostatistics<br>
            II. Precision Medicine. Research Aims:<br>
            1 Mechanisms underlying diseases, researchers can identify potential targets for intervention<br>
            2 Genetic factors that make certain individuals more susceptible<br><br>
            Complements:<br>
            1 Mobile health technologies and telemedicine: provide populations with remote access to healthcare services<br>
            2 Genetic testing and remote monitoring: delivering personalized care to individuals in underserved or remote areas<br>
            Public Health:<br>
            Health needs in the context of forced displacement<br>
            Trauma, malnutrition, infectious diseases, & language and cultural barriers<br>
            Costs on health delivery and refugee resettlement<br>
            Access to healthcare, social determinants of health in refugee populations, and the impact on host communities<br><br>
            Tailoring interventions to context<br>
            Systems biology approaches are the tools necessary to intervene.
